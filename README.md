# Treasure-Hunt-Game
This is a treasure hunt game where the player moves around in a ship and find the treasure. The player can either move around the map and find the treasure or use a sonar to detect the shortest path to the treasure. The shortest path from the ship to the treasure is found using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm uses the Heap data structure to keep track of nodes with the shortest distance. Once, the shortest path is found or the player moves onto the treasure location then the game ends. <br />

There is also a Graphical User Interface which allows the user to play the game.
